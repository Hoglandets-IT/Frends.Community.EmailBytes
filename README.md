# Installing
You can install the Task via frends UI Task View or you can find the NuGet package from the following NuGet feed
https://www.myget.org/F/frends-community/api/v3/index.json and in Gallery view in MyGet https://www.myget.org/feed/frends-community/package/nuget/Frends.HIT.Email

# Prerequisites for Exchange

Due to deprication of legacy authentication to Exchange, tasks related to Exchange are using Microsoft Graph.<br/>
Authentication provider used in Exchange tasks is [Username/password provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers?tabs=CS#usernamepassword-provider).<br/>
To use Exchange tasks you need to have a service account which DOES NOT have MFA enabled and an App Registration with following configurations:<br/>

From authentication, Allow public client flows has to be set on, since Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow is a public client flow.<br/>
![](img/allow_public_client_flows.png)

From API permissions, you need to add delegate permissions for Mail.ReadWrite and Mail.Send from Microsoft Graph. In addition, these permissions need admin consent.<br/>
Without admin consent Graph will require interactive authentication for the user, which is not possible with Frends.<br/>

Note that if you want to read emails from other users mailbox instead of the users which you use to authenticate (on behalf of other user), you need to use Shared API permissions.<br/>

| 4.1.3   | ReadEmailFromExchangeServer: Ignore ItemAttachments to prevent failing of the Task if attachment is ItemAttachment instead of FileAttachment.             |
| 4.2.0   | SendEmail: Added feature to add custom headers to email sending.                                                                                          |
